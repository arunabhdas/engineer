The app will have the following core classes:\n\n1. `MainActivity`: This is the entry point of the app. It will host the main screen of the app and manage the navigation between different screens.\n\n2. `StockListScreen`: This screen will display a list of stocks fetched from the TwelveData API.\n\n3. `CryptoListScreen`: This screen will display a list of cryptocurrencies fetched from the TwelveData API.\n\n4. `StockDetailScreen`: This screen will display detailed information about a selected stock.\n\n5. `CryptoDetailScreen`: This screen will display detailed information about a selected cryptocurrency.\n\n6. `StockViewModel`: This ViewModel will handle fetching and storing the stock data from the TwelveData API.\n\n7. `CryptoViewModel`: This ViewModel will handle fetching and storing the cryptocurrency data from the TwelveData API.\n\n8. `TwelveDataApiService`: This is the service class that will handle the actual API calls to the TwelveData API.\n\n9. `Stock`: This data class will represent a stock.\n\n10. `Crypto`: This data class will represent a cryptocurrency.\n\nNow, let's start with the entry point of the app, `MainActivity.kt`.\n\nMainActivity.kt\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity\nimport android.os.Bundle\nimport androidx.activity.compose.setContent\nimport androidx.compose.material.MaterialTheme\nimport androidx.compose.material.Surface\nimport androidx.navigation.compose.rememberNavController\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.theme.StockAppTheme\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.navigation.Navigation\n\nclass MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        setContent {\n            StockAppTheme {\n                // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme\n                Surface(color = MaterialTheme.colors.background) {\n                    val navController = rememberNavController()\n                    Navigation(navController)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `Navigation.kt` file which will handle the navigation between different screens.\n\nNavigation.kt\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.compose.runtime.Composable\nimport androidx.navigation.NavHostController\nimport androidx.navigation.compose.NavHost\nimport androidx.navigation.compose.composable\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.screens.CryptoListScreen\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.screens.StockListScreen\n\n@Composable\nfun Navigation(navController: NavHostController) {\n    NavHost(navController = navController, startDestination = \"stock_list\") {\n        composable(\"stock_list\") { StockListScreen(navController) }\n        composable(\"crypto_list\") { CryptoListScreen(navController) }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `StockListScreen.kt` and `CryptoListScreen.kt` files which will display the list of stocks and cryptocurrencies respectively.\n\nStockListScreen.kt\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.compose.runtime.Composable\nimport androidx.navigation.NavHostController\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.components.StockList\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.viewmodel.StockViewModel\n\n@Composable\nfun StockListScreen(navController: NavHostController) {\n    val viewModel: StockViewModel = hiltViewModel()\n    StockList(viewModel = viewModel, navController = navController)\n}\n```\n\nCryptoListScreen.kt\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.compose.runtime.Composable\nimport androidx.navigation.NavHostController\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.components.CryptoList\nimport com.example.stockapp.ui.viewmodel.CryptoViewModel\n\n@Composable\nfun CryptoListScreen(navController: NavHostController) {\n    val viewModel: CryptoViewModel = hiltViewModel()\n    CryptoList(viewModel = viewModel, navController = navController)\n}\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `StockViewModel.kt` and `CryptoViewModel.kt` files which will handle fetching and storing the stock and cryptocurrency data respectively.\n\nStockViewModel.kt\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel\nimport androidx.lifecycle.viewModelScope\nimport com.example.stockapp.data.model.Stock\nimport com.example.stockapp.data.repository.StockRepository\nimport kotlinx.coroutines.launch\n\nclass StockViewModel(private val repository: StockRepository) : ViewModel() {\n    val stocks: LiveData<List<Stock>> = repository.stocks\n\n    init {\n        fetchStocks()\n    }\n\n    private fun fetchStocks() {\n        viewModelScope.launch {\n            repository.fetchStocks()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCryptoViewModel.kt\n```kotlin\nimport androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel\nimport androidx.lifecycle.viewModelScope\nimport com.example.stockapp.data.model.Crypto\nimport com.example.stockapp.data.repository.CryptoRepository\nimport kotlinx.coroutines.launch\n\nclass CryptoViewModel(private val repository: CryptoRepository) : ViewModel() {\n    val cryptos: LiveData<List<Crypto>> = repository.cryptos\n\n    init {\n        fetchCryptos()\n    }\n\n    private fun fetchCryptos() {\n        viewModelScope.launch {\n            repository.fetchCryptos()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, let's create the `TwelveDataApiService.kt` file which will handle the actual API calls to the TwelveData API.\n\nTwelveDataApiService.kt\n```kotlin\nimport com.example.stockapp.data.model.Crypto\nimport com.example.stockapp.data.model.Stock\nimport retrofit2.http.GET\n\ninterface TwelveDataApiService {\n    @GET(\"stocks\")\n    suspend fun getStocks(): List<Stock>\n\n    @GET(\"cryptos\")\n    suspend fun getCryptos(): List<Crypto>\n}\n```\n\nFinally, let's create the `Stock.kt` and `Crypto.kt` files which will represent a stock and a cryptocurrency respectively.\n\nStock.kt\n```kotlin\ndata class Stock(\n    val symbol: String,\n    val name: String,\n    val price: Double,\n    val change: Double,\n    val changePercent: Double\n)\n```\n\nCrypto.kt\n```kotlin\ndata class Crypto(\n    val symbol: String,\n    val name: String,\n    val price: Double,\n    val change: Double,\n    val changePercent: Double\n)\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the app and there are many other details that need to be handled such as error handling, loading states, UI design, etc. Also, the actual API endpoints and the data model might be different depending on the TwelveData API."}]
