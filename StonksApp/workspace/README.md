Given the requirements, we will need to create an Android app using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app will have the following core classes:

1. `MainActivity`: This is the entry point of the app. It will host the main screen of the app and manage the navigation between different screens.

2. `StockListScreen`: This screen will display a list of stocks fetched from the TwelveData API.

3. `CryptoListScreen`: This screen will display a list of cryptocurrencies fetched from the TwelveData API.

4. `StockDetailScreen`: This screen will display detailed information about a selected stock.

5. `CryptoDetailScreen`: This screen will display detailed information about a selected cryptocurrency.

6. `StockViewModel`: This ViewModel will handle fetching and storing the stock data from the TwelveData API.

7. `CryptoViewModel`: This ViewModel will handle fetching and storing the cryptocurrency data from the TwelveData API.

8. `TwelveDataApiService`: This is the service class that will handle the actual API calls to the TwelveData API.

9. `Stock`: This data class will represent a stock.

10. `Crypto`: This data class will represent a cryptocurrency.

Now, let's start with the entry point of the app, `MainActivity.kt`.
